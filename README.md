> **WARNING:** This repository is for those who want to STOP paying monthly subscriptions for AI voiceovers. If you prefer renting your software, this is not for you.

## 🏴‍☠️ The Problem: The "SaaS Tax"
Most AI voice cloning services (like ElevenLabs, HeyGen, etc.) operate on a **"Credit System"**.
* You pay $20/month.
* You get 100,000 characters.
* You run out of credits in 3 days.
* **You pay again.**

You are renting the intelligence. You do not own it.

## ⚔️ The Solution: RenderStack Audio (Local Inference)
We have built a standalone, portable engine that runs **Coqui XTTS v2** and **Edge Neural TTS** directly on your own NVIDIA GPU.

### 🚀 Key Features
* **Zero Monthly Fees:** Pay once, own it forever.
* **Unlimited Generation:** Generate 10 hours of audio? It costs you $0.00.
* **Data Privacy:** Everything happens on your machine. No audio is sent to the cloud.
* **Instant Voice Cloning:** Clone any voice with just a 6-second audio sample.
* **Long-Form Support:** Optimized for audiobooks and long YouTube video narration.
